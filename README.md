# TensorFlow-Developer

This is done as a part of DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program. It teaches you applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so you can build and train powerful models. 

TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, I learned the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. After finishing this program, I was able to apply my new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects.
