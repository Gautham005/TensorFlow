# Deep Learning using TensorFlow

This repository contains implementations of deep learning solutions using Tensorflow. Best practices to train a neural network for a deep learning applications. In most cases, the notebooks lead you through implementation of models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, long short-term memory and GRUs. There are other topics covered such as weight intialization and batch normalization.
